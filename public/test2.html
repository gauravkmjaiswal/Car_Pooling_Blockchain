These suggestions help you set fair contributions for your rides (those most likely to get your seats filled!), but can still be adjusted within a margin of our recommendation.\n\nWe help you with the price to make it easy to share your costs, but also to prevent people from profiting from carpooling.\n\nThe amount you see is calculated based on what will help you save the most on your travel costs (fuel, wear and tear, etc.) for a given ride. It’s also specific to how far you’re going, with a set amount for each mile you’re travelling (£0.11 / mile per passenger).\n\nIt might also help you to know that rather than setting a different amount depending on what country you publish the ride in, the contribution and currency are based on the departure town or city, which is more simple and transparent for everyone, no matter where they’re located.\n\nWhen your ride includes stopovers, we use the departure city to calculate the contribution for that leg, too.\n\nFor example, if your ride is published from London to Paris with a stopover in Calais, the amount for the whole ride from London to Paris will be calculated with British pricing because the departure city is in the UK, just like the London to Calais leg. However, the amount between Calais and Paris will be calculated with French pricing since the departure city is in France.","publish.newbie_lp.faq.item.0.question":"How do I set the passenger contribution for my ride?","publish.newbie_lp.faq.item.1.answer":"We send your money 48 hours after the ride if you travelled as planned.

The Card is issued for a value of 25€, which is stated on the front of the Card. The Card is accepted for the acquisition of fuel and other products and services (e.g. carwash and products in shops) within the Network, with the exception of the following products: tobacco, strong alcohols and spirits, books, press, French game products, infant formula. The products and services for which the Card is accepted are mentioned on the back of the Card. The conditions for activating the Card are specified in the letter accompanying the Card. The Card is accepted within the Network until the expiry date indicated on the Card. If a Card is presented in the Network before its activation date, the Driver will be asked to pay by another means. The expiry date is shown on the front of the Card. Each Card remains valid up to and including the last day of the month of validity mentioned. At the end of this period of validity, the Card will not be taken back, exchanged or refunded.","total.cgu.1.sub_label":"1. Characteristics of the Card","total.cgu.2.paragraph":"The Card works without a PIN code. Use on one or more occasions: The Card may be used on one or more occasions for the value mentioned on the Card and before its expiry date to acquire in the Network the products and services mentioned on the back of the Card. Receipt: When the Card is used in the Network, a receipt is given to the Driver showing the VAT corresponding to the fuel, products and/or services thus acquired. Mixed payment methods: If the balance of the Card is insufficient to make a purchase, the Driver who owns the Card must complete the outstanding balance with the means of payment of his or her choice (another Card - within the limit of 3 Jubileo Cards accumulated for the same purchase, bank card, check, cash) accepted by the Network. Defective Card: In the event of a defective Card and in the absence of damage caused by the Driver, the Driver may contact TOTAL Consumer Services at the number shown on the back of the Card, who may offer to return the Card concerned. After checking the validity and balance of the defective Card, TOTAL Raffinage Marketing may send a new Card to the Driver, with the balance of the defective Card and with a period of validity corresponding to that of the defective Card extended by one month. TOTAL Raffinage Marketing reserves the right to update or modify this treatment of so-called defective Cards. The TOTAL Consumer Service will inform the Driver of the new applicable terms and conditions when he or she calls. Technical incident: If a technical incident prevents a purchase from being made with the Card, the Driver who owns the Card must pay the amount due with a means of payment likely to be unaffected by this incident (bank check, cash). The Driver who owns the Card may not request any sum of money from TOTAL Raffinage Marketing in exchange for the return of a Card, whether expired or not, started or not, unless a credit note is issued in accordance with article 3 of the general terms and conditions of sale of the Card, available on the website www.gr.total.fr. If the Driver wishes to return the product acquired using the Card, no reimbursement or reloading of the Card will be made. An invalid Card, in particular an expired or falsified Card, may be kept by the Network service station that has identified the invalidity of the Card. It is the responsibility of the Driver who owns the Card to use up the balance of any Card before its validity expires. Any amount remaining on an expired Card will be forfeited. The Driver remains responsible for the Card and its use until its validity expires.
